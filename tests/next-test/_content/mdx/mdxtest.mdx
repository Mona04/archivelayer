## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled
  - this is very interesting
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
 and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.


## Code Syntax Highlight Test

```c# {1-3,4} showLineNumbers /Hello/
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

```cpp title="main.cpp" caption="adsf" showLineNumbers{1} {1,3-4} 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main()
{
  int a = 0;
  cout << a << endl;
}
```

```cout{:.a}``` is good


```cpp title="main.cpp" caption="adsf" showLineNumbers{1} {2-3,5} 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main()
{
  int a = 0;
  cout << a << endl;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    srand(time(0));  // Seed the random number generator with current time
    int secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;  // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    int guess;
    int tries = 0;

    cout << "Welcome to the Guess the Number game!" << endl;
    cout << "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?" << endl;

    do {
        cout << "Enter your guess: ";
        cin >> guess;
        tries++;

        if (guess < secretNumber) {
            cout << "Too low! Try again." << endl;
        } else if (guess > secretNumber) {
            cout << "Too high! Try again." << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the number " << secretNumber << " in " << tries << " tries." << endl;
        }
    } while (guess != secretNumber);

    return 0;
}
